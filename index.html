    <h2>Disclaimer!</h2>
    <p>
      This website only exist because I found it cool to be able to see everyones performance on the Cup of the Day, a knot-out daily competition hosted by Nadeo.</p> <p>You can check you own profile or the ones of the others, so please, do not use this tool to judge / make fun of somebody or anything, because some players play the cotd just for fun (so no judgement allowed here).</p>
<p> To access a profile, enter a name (or just a part of a name), and you will see all corresponding player that match your search. To see someone's profile, click on the see profile button</p>

        <p>On the last Cup of the Day, we had <i id="numberNewPlayers"></i> new players that had never played one before.</p>

    <p><i>In order to be registered in our database, you must have participated in, at least, one Cup of the Day (<b>UPDATE</b>: I have added the players from <a href="https://opentrackmania.com/" target="_blank">opentrackmania.com</a>).

        <p>
      I started tracking the pseudo on the 9th of feb. 2021, so logins before that are not registered (Also keep in mind that, if you change your pseudo, it will only update if you play a new cotd).
        </p>
        <p> More things will eventually come (like A08 cup results). Or also, a graph visualisation (better than table...). If you have some request of things that you would like to see, you can contact me on Discord (see below)</p>

<p>With the very limited knowledge I had on APIs, this project was only made possible thanks to trackmania.io, that has a very easy to use one. So big thanks to <a href="https://discord.gg/kkh6HaxGyU">@Miss</a> for her work.</p>
